\ac{CMS} has recently explored the extremely rare $\gamma\gamma\tau\tau$ decay channel (0.028% branching ratio), for the first time, using full Run2 data [[cite:&gammagammatautau]].
The analysis covers both resonant and nonresonant production.
We focus on the latter.

The analysis exploits di-$\gamma$ triggers only, as triggering on the \tau's is found to have negligible impact.
Standard photon and lepton selections are applied.
The dominant backgrounds are peaking single-H and nonresonant \gamma+jets, \gamma\gamma+jets, $\ttbar+\gamma$, $\ttbar+\gamma\gamma$, $W\gamma$ and $Z\gamma$.
Minor backgrounds are taken from simulation.
The signal is fitted independently for different categories and data taking years with a double crystall ball function.
The background also includes a \hgg{} contribution which is modelled just like the signal.
The background continuum, instead, uses the discrete profiling method [[cite:&discrete_profiling]], which considers multiple analytical functions and penalizes those with many parameters.
Interestingly, \tauâ€™s are reconstructed in all its 6 decay modes ($ee$, $\mu\mu$, $e\mu$, $e\tau_{h}$, $\mu\tau_{h}$ and $\tau_{h}\tau_{h}$), and additionally the single $\tau_{h}$ and $\tau_{h}+\text{track}$ channels are considered when no electron or muon pass the selection.
A DY mass cut vetoes events compatible with \zll{} or \zllg{} close to the mass of the Z.
A (di-photon) mass-independent \ac{BDT} is used, considering input features related to the events' kinematic properties.
Sequential boundaries are applied to the \ac{BDT}'s output to create two categories of different signal purities.
The splitting maximizes signal sensitivity.
Events not belonging to one those categories are discarded.
The final results are obtained performing a simultaneous maximum likelihood fit to $\mgg$ in the two signal-enriched categories.
As predicted by the SM, the analysis observes very few $\gamma\gamma\tau\tau$ candidates.
It delivers observed (expected) $\kl$ 95% \ac{CL} upper limits, $-13\;(-11) < k_{\lambda} < 18\;(16)$, and on the HH proton-proton cross-section, $\sigma_{\text{HH}} < 930\;(740)\;\si{\femto\barn}$ or $\sigma_{\text{HH}} < 33\;(26)\;\sigma_{\text{HH}}^{\text{SM}}$.
The limits are around one order of magnitude worse than the ones obtained with the most sensitive channels.
