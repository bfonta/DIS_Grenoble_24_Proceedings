<<sec:intro>>

The production of Higgs boson pairs (HH), despite its rarity and experimental challenges, has become a central piece of the scientific programme of \ac{CMS} at the \ac{LHC}.
Measurements of the Higgs self-coupling $\kl$ provide a unique \ac{SM} consistency test, probe the stability of the vaccum of our Universe, and might help establishing new theoretical explanations for baryogenesis [[cite:&higgs_10_years;&YellowReport4]].
We report the most recent \ac{CMS} HH results.
