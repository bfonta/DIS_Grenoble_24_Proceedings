#+LATEX_HEADER: \abstract{The production of Higgs boson pairs (HH) at the LHC is the main handle for the measurement of the Higgs boson interaction with itself and is thus a fundamental test of the Standard Model theory as well as for determining the Higgs potential. The most recent results from the CMS Collaboration on measurements of nonresonant HH production using different final states, and their combination using the data set collected by the CMS experiment at a centre of mass energy of 13 TeV, will be presented.}
